# hello-world
Today its "Hello World", Tomorrow it will be "HAL. Open the Pod Bay Door"...
Hi,
My name is Akash Agnihotri, I like tabs over spaces, they are cleaner, I know you are judging me, but hey..my "hello world" my rules.
And also.. not javascript is not like java, and python is not named after the snake, please stop it, it is just embarrassing.

Thank You,
